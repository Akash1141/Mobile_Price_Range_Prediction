# Mobile_Price_Range_Prediction

## Project Overview

The Mobile Price Range Prediction project aims to analyze and predict the price range of mobile phones based on various specifications and features. In the competitive mobile phone market, understanding the factors that influence pricing decisions is crucial for manufacturers and retailers. This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide insights and predictions for mobile phone pricing.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about mobile phone specifications, including battery capacity, camera quality, memory, connectivity options, and more. It comprises 2,000 rows of data, each representing a mobile phone, and includes a target variable categorizing price ranges (e.g., low cost, medium cost, high cost, very high cost).

Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand the project's workflow and analysis.

Run the Python scripts in the src/ directory to train and evaluate machine learning models.

Model Selection
The project compares the performance of three classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). After hyperparameter tuning, the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy and was selected as the final prediction model.

Evaluation Metrics
The project emphasizes the importance of selecting evaluation metrics aligned with specific business objectives. Common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.

Business Impact
Understanding the insights gained from this project can help mobile phone manufacturers and retailers make informed decisions regarding product features and pricing strategies. It can also assist in staying competitive in the dynamic mobile phone market.
